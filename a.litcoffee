# A simple piece of prose

There is much one can write on performing the noble arts of hacking. But often
enough, words are what we fall short of. And writing without words is like
speaking without sounds or a notion of words, which is nothing more than waves
of possibilities.

    root = window ? this
    console.log root
    x = 2
    y = (x) -> x*x
    do -> console.log y 3

And so as everything comes to an end...

### Thanks for listening
